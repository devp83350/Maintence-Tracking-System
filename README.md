# Maintence-Tracking-System
Develop a maintenance management system that allows a company to track its assets (machines, vehicles, computers) and manage maintenance requests for those assets. Core Philosophy: The module must seamlessly connect Equipment (what is broken), Teams (who fix it), and Requests (the work to be done).

# A. Equipment
The system serves as a central database for all company assets. Participants must create a
robust "Equipment" record that tracks ownership and technical details.
● Equipment Tracking(use the search or group by for tracking the request):
○ By Department: (e.g., A CNC Machine belongs to the "Production" department).
○ By Employee: (e.g., A Laptop belongs to "Person name").
● Responsibility: Each equipment must have a dedicated Maintenance Team and a
technician is assigned to it by default.
● Key fields:
○ Equipment Name & Serial Number.
○ Purchase Date & Warranty Information.
○ Location: Where is this machine physically located?
B. Maintenance Team
The system must support multiple specialized teams.
● Team Name: Ability to define teams (e.g., Mechanics, Electricians, IT Support).
● Team Member Name: Link specific users (Technicians) to these teams.
● Workflow Logic: When a request is created for a specific team, only team members
should pick it up.


Participants must implement the following business logic to make the module "alive."
Flow 1: The Breakdown
1. Request: Any user can create a request.
2. Auto-Fill Logic: When the user selects an Equipment (e.g., "Printer 01"):
○ The system should automatically fetch the Equipment category and
Maintenance Team from the equipment record and fill them into the request.
3. Request state: The request starts in the New stage.
4. Assignment: A manager or technician assigns themselves to the ticket.
5. Execution: The stage moves to In Progress.
6. Completion: The technician records the Hours Spent (Duration) and moves the stage
to Repaired.
Flow 2: The Routine Checkup
1. Scheduling: A manager creates a request with the type Preventive.
2. Date Setting: The user sets a Scheduled Date (e.g., Next Monday).
3. Visibility: This request must appear on the Calendar View on the specific date so the
technician knows they have a job to do.
To provide

These features distinguish a basic form from a smart "Odoo-like" module.
● Smart Buttons:
○ On the Equipment Form, add a button labeled "Maintenance".
○ Function: Clicking this button opens a list of all requests related only to that
specific machine.
○ Badge: The button should display the count of open requests.
● Scrap Logic:
○ If a request is moved to the Scrap stage, the system should logically indicate that
the equipment is no longer usable (e.g., log a note or set a flag).

# Maintence-Tracking-System
Develop a maintenance management system that allows a company to track its assets (machines, vehicles, computers) and manage maintenance requests for those assets. Core Philosophy: The module must seamlessly connect Equipment (what is broken), Teams (who fix it), and Requests (the work to be done).
